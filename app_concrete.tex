\section{Concrete Instantiations for the Constructions }\label{app:concrete}
We discuss several possibilities for instantiating the primitives used in our constructions. Throughout the first part of this work (Section~\ref{sec:dargs} and Section~\ref{sec:distprover}), we use several cryptographic primitives, some of them quite strong. Here we refine them and show from which concrete assumptions each of them can be constructed.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:concDargs}
    Let $\Lan$ be a graph language, such that $\Lan\in \NP$. Assuming collision-resistant hash families,
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item There is a succinct \emph{interactive} distributed argument with 4 rounds of communication for $\Lan$. 
        \item In the random oracle model, there is a succinct non-interactive distributed argument for $\Lan$.
        \item In the common reference string model, assuming \emph{Knowledge-of-Exponent in Bilinear Groups}, there is a succinct non-interactive distributed argument for $\Lan$. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
From Theorem~\ref{thm:centralized} and ~\cite{merkle1989certified}, we get that part (1) follows from \cite{kilian1992note}, part (2) follows from \cite{micali2000computationally} and part (3) follows from~\cite{bitansky2013SNARKsLIPs}.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:RAMSNARGs}
    Let $\Lan$ be a graph language, such that $\Lan\in \PP$. Assuming collision-resistant hash families, there is a succinct distributed argument for $\Lan$, assuming either
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The $O(1)-\LIN$ assumption on a pair of cryptographic groups with efficient bilinear map, or
        \item A combination of the sub-exponential $\DDH$ assumption and the $\QR$ assumption.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
As shown in  \cite{cryptoeprint:2022/1320}, Flexible RAM SNARGs exist under any of these assumptions. Together with theorem~\ref{theo:P}, this implies Theorem \ref{thm:RAMSNARGs}.

Let $\calD$ be a distributed algorithm that runs in $T = \poly(n)$ rounds
    and sends messages of length $\poly(n)$.
    Assuming SNARKs for $\NP$ %exist,
    and %assuming
    a certain type of collision-resistant hash functions exist,%
    \footnote{We require a new property called \emph{sum collision resistance}, see Section~\ref{sec:distprover}.}
    there is a distributed argument of length $\polylog(n)$
    certifying $\calD$'s execution, where the prover is an efficient distributed algorithm
    running in $O(T + \diam(G))$ rounds and sending messages of $\polylog(n)$ bits.
\begin{theorem}
    Let $\calD$ be a distributed algorithm that runs in $T = \poly(n)$ rounds and sends messages of length $\poly(n)$. Assuming sum-collision-resistant hash families,
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item There is a succinct \emph{interactive} distributed argument with 4 rounds of communication for $\Lan$. 
        \item In the random oracle model, there is a succinct non-interactive distributed argument for $\Lan$.
        \item In the common reference string model, assuming \emph{Knowledge-of-Exponent in Bilinear Groups}, there is a succinct non-interactive distributed argument for $\Lan$. 
    \end{enumerate}
    Where in all of the cases above, the prover is an efficient distributed algorithm
    running in $O(T + \diam(G))$ rounds and sending messages of $\polylog(n)$ bits.
\end{theorem}
