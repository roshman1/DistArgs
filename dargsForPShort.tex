\subsection{Construction of LVD-SNARGs for P from RAM SNARGs}\label{sec:dargsForP}
We give a %very
high-level sketch of our construction for distributed languages in $\PP$,
which relies on RAM SNARGs; the details appear in Appendix~\ref{app:dargsForP}.

For a configuration $(G,x)$, for every $v\in V(G)$, let $i_v$ be the index of $v$ in a lexicographically ordered list of the UIDs of $V(G)$. Let $L_{G,x}$ be the list where for every $i\in [n]$, $L_{G,x}[i] = (v, x(v), N_G(v))$. $L_{G,x}$ is considered valid \TODO{should we refer the validity at all} if for every $v,u\in V(G)$, $v\in N(u) \Leftrightarrow u\in N(v)$ (that is, it represents an undirected graph), and furthermore, it represents a \emph{connected} graph. 

For a distributed language $\Lan\in\PP$, we define the following language:
\begin{gather*}
    \Lan^* = \left\{ L_{G,x} ~\middle|~ \begin{array}{ll}
         %c = \HT.\Hash(\hk, L_{G,x})  \\
         (G,x)\in\Lan \\
         \wedge ~L_{G,x}~\text{ is valid }
    \end{array} \right\}
\end{gather*}

Since $\Lan\in \PP$, there is a polynomial time algorithm $A$, such that $A(G,x)=1 \Leftrightarrow (G,x)\in \Lan$. Since given $L$, it is easy to check whether it is valid, there's also a polynomial-time algorithm $A'$ such that $A'(L) = 1 \iff L\in \Lan^*$.

Let $\HT = (\HT.\Gen, \HT.\Hash, \HT.\Open, \HT.\Ver)$ be a hash family with local openings.
\footnote{$\HT$ is not required to be recursively constructable for this section.}


Let $\SNARG = (\SNARGGen, \SNARGHash, \SNARGPro, \SNARGVer)$ be a SNARG for $\Lan^*$ defined with respect to $\HT$.

The $\mathbin{\color{red}1}$-locally verifiable SNARG for $\Lan$, ($\Gen, \Pro, \Ver$) is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Gen(1^\secpar, 1^n)$ outputs $\crs = (\hk, \SNARG.\crs) = (\HT.\Gen(1^\secpar, 1^N), \SNARGGen(1^\secpar, 1^n))$
    \item $\Pro(\crs, G, x)$
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Parse $\crs = \hk, \SNARG.\crs$
        \item Compute $C = \HT.\Hash(\hk, L_{G,x})$
        \item For every $v\in V(G)$, compute $\rho_v = \HT.\Open(\hk, L_G, i)$
        \TODO{Explaine the bit-wise meaning of this}
        \item Compute $\SNARG.\pi = \SNARGPro(\crs,L_{G,x})$
        \item output $\{\pi_v\}_{v\in V(G)}$ where for every $v\in V(G)$, $\pi_v = C, \rho_v, \SNARG.\pi$
    \end{enumerate}
    \item $\Ver(\var{\crs}, v, N(v), \pi_v, \pi_{N(v)} )$
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Parse $\crs = \hk, \SNARG.\crs$
        \item Parse $\pi_v = C, \rho_v, \SNARG.\pi$
        \item Parse $\pi_{N(v)} = \{\pi_u\}_{u\in N(v)} = \{C_u, \rho_u, \SNARG.\pi_u\}$
        %\item %Send $C$ to every neighbor $u\in N(v)$ and receive $C_u$ from every $u\in N(v)$.
        \item Verify the following:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\forall u\in N(v): ~C_u = C$. \label{consistency}
            \item $\HT.\Ver(\hk, C, v, x(v), N(v)) = 1$. \label{openings}
            \item $\SNARGVer(\SNARG.\crs, C, 1, \SNARG.\pi) = 1$.\label{snargproofver}
        \end{enumerate} 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\begin{proof}[Soundness proof sketch.]
    Since the $\SNARG.\pi$ is verified in step    \ref{snargproofver}, we get from the soundness of the $\SNARG$ scheme that $C$ can be fully-opened
    \footnote{
    By fully-opening a hash value $\val$ to a list $L$ we mean that for every index $i\in |L|$,  $\HT.\Ver(\hk, \val, L_i) = 1$.
    }
    into an $L'$ such that $L'\notin \Lan^*$ with only negligible probability. (If it could, by the $\SNARG$ completeness, \footnote{
    \TODO{Decide how to refer the "augmented completeness" that's required here}
    }
    we would be able to construct a $\SNARG$ proof $\pi'$ such that $\SNARG.\Ver(\SNARG.\crs, C, 0, \SNARG.\pi') = 1$). 
    In particular, it cannot be fully-opened into a non-valid $L'$. 
    
    Since the hash value $C$ is compared between nodes in step ~\ref{consistency}, and its openings are checked everywhere in step ~\ref{openings},
    $C$ is fully-opened to some $L_{G',x'}$ such that $V(G')\subseteq V(G)$,  $E(G')\subseteq E(G)$ and $\{x'(v)\}_{v\in V(G)} = \{x(v)\}_{v\in V(G)}$. %From the collision-resistance w.r.t openings of the $\HT$ scheme, $C$     can be fully-opened to a $L_{G',x'}$ such that $V(G')\not\subseteq V(G)$, or $E(G')\not\subseteq E(G)$, or $\{x'(v)\}_{v\in V(G)}\neq\{x(v)\}_{v\in V(G)}$ with only negligible probability.
    
    Now, note that for every $L_{G',x'}$ such that $V(G')\subseteq V(G)$,  $E(G')\subseteq E(G)$ and $\{x'(v)\}_{v\in V(G)} = \{x(v)\}_{v\in V(G)}$, either $L_{G',x'}$ is invalid or $(G',x') = (G,x)$. So, for any $(G,x)\neq (G',x')$, $C$ is fully-opened to $L_{G',x'}$ only with negligible probability.
    
    So, except for with a negligible probability, $C$ is fully-opened to $L_{G,x}$, and $L_{G,x}\in\Lan^*$, which means $(G,x)\in\Lan$.
\end{proof}
