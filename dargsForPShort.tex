\subsection{Succinct Distributed Arguments for P from RAM SNARGs}\label{sec:dargsForP}
We give a very high-level sketch of our construction for graph languages in $\PP$,
which does not rely on knowledge assumptions; the details appear in Appendix~\ref{app:dargsForP}.

The construction uses a primitive called a \emph{flexible RAM SNARG for $\PP$}~\cite{KP16,cryptoeprint:2022/1320},
whose precise definition we defer to Appendix~\ref{app:ramsnargs}.
In general, a %RAM
SNARG is used to prove statements of the form ``$M(x) = b$'',
where $M$ is a deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine, $x$ is an input,
and $b \in \set{0,1}$ indicates whether $M$ accepts or rejects the input.%
\footnote{Since $\PP$ is closed under complement, we can prove both membership in $\calL(M)$
and non-membership in $\calL(M)$.}
The key property of the RAM SNARG of~\cite{KP16,cryptoeprint:2022/1320} is that 
the prover and the verifier
are actually not given the instance $x$,
but only a \emph{hash} of $x$, called a \emph{digest},
which is much shorter than the input $x$ itself.
Roughly speaking, the prover then proves the statement ``$M$ outputs $b \in \set{0,1}$
on the input whose digest is $d$''.

Of course, this is not well-defined: since the digest $x$ is much shorter than $x$,
there may be \emph{many} inputs that have the same digest as $x$---%
some of them may be accepted by $M$, and some may be rejected.
What does it mean to prove that ``$M$ outputs $b$ on the input whose digest is $d$'',
when this input is not unique?
This is resolved in~\cite{KP16} by re-defining
the soundness of the SNARG:
we now require only that 
an
efficient adversary should not be able to find a digest $d$ and two proofs $\pi_0, \pi_1$,
such that $\pi_0$ convinces the verifier that $M$ rejects,
and $\pi_1$ convinces the verifier that $M$ accepts (both with respect to ``some input'' whose digest is $d$).
This suffices for our purposes here.

The digest we use is a vector commitment $c$ to the network graph, which the prover
computes and gives to all the nodes, as in the previous section.
In addition, the prover computes a RAM SNARG proof for the statement ``the graph whose vector commitment
is $c$ is accepted by $M$'', where $M$ is a deterministic Turing machine that decides
the graph language $\calL = \calL(M)$ that we would like to certify.
As before, each node opens its entry in the vector commitment and verifies that its neighborhood
is correctly represented, and then the nodes verify the SNARG proof.

The soundess proof for the new construction is quite different from the previous one:
before, we relied on the proof-of-knowledge property, which allowed us to \emph{extract}
from a cheating prover $\Pro^*$
a concrete graph $G' \neq G$ that has the same vector commitment as $G$,
and argue that $\Pro^*$ breaks the position-binding property of the vector commitment.
A SNARG does not have the proof-of-knowledge property,
so even if the prover $\Pro$* has successfully convinced all nodes to accept a graph $G \not \in \calL$,
this does not mean we can use $\Pro^*$ to \emph{find} a graph $G' \neq G$ that has the same vector commitment as $G$.
To get around this issue,
we require an additional property from the vector commitment,
which essentially asserts that for any given vector $(m_1,\ldots,m_q)$,
there is only one commitment $c$ that opens to $m_i$ at every position $i$:
\begin{definition}[Inverse Collision-Resistance]
A VC $(\Gen, \Com, \Open, \Verify)$ is \emph{Inverse Collision-Resistant} if for any efficient algorithm $\calA$, there
is a negligible $\epsilon(\cdot)$ such that for all $\lambda\in \mathbb{N}$,
\begin{gather*}
    \prob{}
    {
    \begin{array}{ll}
         \forall i: \Verify(\crs, C^*, m, i) = 1 \\
         \wedge C^* \neq C
    \end{array}
    \middle\vert
    \begin{array}{ll}
         \crs \leftarrow \Gen(1^\lambda, q) \\
         C^*, \{(m_i, \lambda_i)\}_{i\in [q]} = \calA(\crs) \\
         C \leftarrow \Com(\crs, m_1,\ldots,m_q)
    \end{array}
    } \leq \epsilon(\lambda).
\end{gather*}
\end{definition}
In Appendix~\ref{app:crypto} we show that a succinct inverse collision-resistant VC can be implemented from 
a collision-resistant hash function using a Merkle tree~\cite{merkle1989certified}.

To conclude our sketch of the soundness proof, suppose a cheating prover $\Pro^*$ is able
to
find a graph $G \not \in \calL(M)$ that is accepted by all the nodes with non-negligible probability.
Since $G \not \in \calL(M)$, we know that $M(G) = 0$,
and we can compute the vector commitment $c$ of $G$,
and an honest SNARG proof $\pi_0$ for the statement ``the graph whose vector commitment is $c$
is rejected by $M$''.
However, since $\Pro^*$ was able to convince all nodes to accept,
it has found a proof $\pi_1$ that convinces them that ``the graph whose vector commitment is $c'$
is accepted by $M$'', where $c'$ is \emph{also} a vector commitment to $G$
(otherwise, some node would open its entry in $c'$, see that its neighborhood is not represented correctly, and reject).
By the inverse collision-resistance property of the commitment,
there can only be one commitment that opens correctly at all nodes, and therefore $c = c'$.
But this violates the soundness of the RAM SNARG, as we have now found a digest ($c$)
and two proofs $\pi_0, \pi_1$,
both of which convince the verifiers,
but they prove opposite statements.

%In this section, we construct a succinct distributed argument for $\PP$. The construction itself is very similar to the one for $\NP$, but they differ in the cryptographic primitives they use. In this construction, we use Flexible RAM SNARGs.%, which are known for $\PP$ from standard cryptographic assumptions (see Appendix \TODO{where} for details). 

%\paragraph{RAM Delegation} For a polynomial-time Turing machine $M$, a \emph{RAM Delegation Scheme} for $M$ allows a verifier that does not have full access to an input $x$ (for instance, because $x$ is too long) and holds an alleged output $y$, to verify that $M$ was executed correctly on $x$, and in particular, the output of that execution is indeed $y$.
%In general, a RAM Machine is a deterministic Turing machine that has random access to memory that is much longer (mostly, exponentially longer) than its local state, and a RAM SNARG is a SNARG that proves that a RAM machine indeed outputs a certain output, without having the verifier simulate the entire execution (that requires access to a long memory). A RAM SNARG is associated with a \emph{digest} algorithm, that processes the long input into a much shorter string that the verifier can read.
%The soundness requirement of a RAM SNARG is that no efficient adversary would be able to produce a digest $d$ and two different proofs, $\pi_0$ and $\pi_1$, such that the verifier is convinced by $\pi_0$ that $M$ outputs $0$ and by $\pi_1$ that $M$ outputs $0$.
%The soundness of the Flexible RAM SNARG is defined as follows.\footnote{
%In \cite{cryptoeprint:2022/1320}, it is shown that this soundness notion can be replaced by a different one, called \emph{Partial Input Soundness}. We do not require it.
%}
%A RAM SNARG $(\Gen, \Ver, \Pro)$ for a machine $M$ that has a binary input is sound if for any efficient adversarial prover $\Pro^*$ and a polynomial $T = T(\lambda)$, there exists a negligible function $\epsilon(\cdot)$, such that
%\begin{gather*}
%    \prob{}
%    {
%    \begin{array}{ll}
%    \Ver(\var{\crs}, d, 0, \pi_0) = 1 \\
%    \wedge \Ver(\crs, d, 1, \pi_1) = 1
%    \end{array}
%    \middle\vert
%    \begin{array}{ll}
%    \var{\crs} \leftarrow \Gen(1^\secpar, T) \\
%    (d, x, \pi_0, \pi_1) \leftarrow \Pro^*(\var{\crs}) \\
%    \end{array}
%    } \leq \epsilon(\secpar)
%\end{gather*}
%That is, a RAM SNARG is sound if for any efficient adversary, it cannot produce a proof that $M$ outputs
%In \cite{cryptoeprint:2022/1320}, this definition is extended to \emph{Flexible SNARGs for RAM}, which is a RAM SNARG where the digest can be implemented by any hash family, and the SNARG is sound if that hash family has local openings.

%We use Flexible RAM SNARGs to construct a succinct distributed argument for $\PP$. As mentioned, such RAM SNARGs are defined w.r.t some hash family with local opening. For our use, that hash family will be a succinct vector commitment, which already satisfies all of the hash family with local openings requirements. In addition, we require that the vector commitment has %a property we call \emph{inverse collision-resistance}. A VC is Inverse Collision-Resistant (ICR)\TODO{?} any efficient adversary cannot find a false commitment to a vector, cannot open two different commitments to the same vector in \emph{every} index, such that the verifier is convinced by all openings.

%Let $\Lan$ be a language on graphs that is decidable in polynomial time, given the entire graph as input, and let $M_\Lan$ be the Turing machine that decides it:
%$G\in \Lan \Leftrightarrow M_\Lan(L(G)) = 1$. 
%The idea of our construction is similar to the one in the last section: the prover commits to the graph with the VC, and sends the commitment $c$ with a RAM SNARG proof $\pi$. The main difference is that in the construction for $\NP$, the prover proved that \emph{there exists} a graph $\Tilde{G}$ such that $\Tilde{G}$ is in the language and $c$ is a valid commitment to it, while 
%here, the prover proves that when $M$ accepts $G$. This alone would not be sound; since the VC is succinct, that is, it compresses the input, it might be very likely that there is a graph $\Tilde{G}$ such that $c$ is a valid commitment to it and $\Tilde{G}\in \Lan$. In the construction for $\PP$, the argument of knowledge property of the SNARK guaranteed that if a prover $\Pro^*$ produces an accepted commitment $c$, then it must \emph{know} (that is, we can extract from it) a witness, which includes $G$, and since it is not likely that the prover would know a pre-image of $c$ other then $G$, our argument was sound.
%The RAM SNARG does not have the argument of knowledge property, but instead, the Inverse Collision-Resistance property of the VC guarentees that if $c$ opens to $G$ everywhere, then it is very unlikely that committing to $G$ honestly produces a value $c'\neq c$. If $c$ is indeed the honest commitment to $G$, and $M$ rejects $G$, by the completeness of the SNARG, we can construct a proof $\pi_0$ that is convincing that $M(G)=0$. Since $\Pro^*$ produces $\pi_1$ that convinces the verifier that $M(G)=1$, this breaks the SNARG.
