\section{Succinct Distributed Arguments}\label{sec:dargs}
In this section we define \emph{succinct distributed arguments} and show how to construct them for graph languages in
$\PP$ and in $\NP$.
%In Section~\ref{sec:dargsForP} we give a construction for graph languages in $\PP$, which is similar in spirit
%but uses different cryptographic primitives and has a different soundness proof. In particular, it can be instantiated under \emph{standard} cryptographic assumptions.
For simplicity, in this section and the next,
we restrict attentiont to \emph{graph languages},
where the nodes have no input.
The definition and the constructions easily extend to the case where there are inputs
(see Appendix~\ref{app:code}).

%\subsection{Defining Succinct Distributed Arguments}
%\label{sec:def}
A succinct distributed argument consists of the following algorithms.

\paragraph{$\Gen(1^\secpar, n)\to \var{\crs}$:} a randomized algorithm that takes as input a security parameter $1^\secpar$ and a graph size $n$, and outputs a common reference string $\var{\crs}$.

\paragraph{$\Pro(\var{\crs}, G, w)\to \{\pi_v\}_{v\in V(G)}$:}
%, c, L_i, \Lambda_i)$.}
takes a $\var{\crs}$ obtained from $\Gen(1^{\secpar}, n)$,
, %a node $v$, an index $i$, an adjacency list $L$, where the \ith row is $N(v)$
a graph $G$ on $n$ nodes, and possibly a witness $w$ of length $\poly(n)$ (which may be empty, e.g., for languages in $\PP$),
and outputs a list of proofs $\{\pi(v)\}_{v\in V(G)}$,
one for each node $v \in G$.

\paragraph{$\Ver(\var{\crs}, v, N(v), \pi(v), \pi(N(v)) )\to \{0,1\}$:}
takes a common reference string $\crs$ obtained from $\Gen(1^{\secpar}, n)$,
a UID $v$, a list of neighbors $N(v)$, a proof $\pi(v)$,
and the proofs of the neighbors, $\pi(N(v)) = \set{ \pi(u) : u \in N(v) }$,%
\footnote{For simplicity, we follow the original design of proof labeling schemes~\cite{korman2005proof},
where neighbors only exchange their certificates with their immediate neighbors.
The model can be generalized to allow for more general verification procedures.}
and outputs an acceptance bit.

\begin{definition}\label{defSDarg}
Let $\Lan$ and $\calR$ be an $\NP$ language and a compatible relation on graphs,
such that $G \in \calL$ iff there exists a witness $w$ such that $(G,w) \in \calR$.
A \emph{succinct distributed argument} for $\Lan$ and $\calR$, denoted $(\Gen, \Pro, \Ver)$, satisfies the following properties:
\paragraph{Completeness}  For $(G,w)\in \calR$,
\begin{gather*}
    \prb
    {
    	\forall v \in V(G):\\
	    \Ver(\crs, v, N(v), \pi(v), \pi(N(v))) = 1
	}
	{
    \crs \leftarrow \Gen(1^\secpar, n) \\
    \set{ \pi(v) }_{v\in V(G)} \leftarrow \Pro(\var{\crs}, G, w)
    }
    = 1
    .
\end{gather*}
\paragraph{Soundness}
For any efficient algorithm $\Pro^*$ %, and $G\notin \Lan$,
there exists a negligible function $\epsilon(\cdot)$ such that
\begin{gather*}
    \prob{}
    {
    \begin{array}{ll}
    G\notin \Lan \\
    \wedge\ \forall v\in V(G) :\\
    \quad \Ver(\var{\crs}, v, N(v), \pi_{v}, \pi(N(v))) = 1
    \end{array}
    \middle\vert
    \begin{array}{ll}
    \var{\crs} \leftarrow \Gen(1^\secpar, n) \\
    ( G, \{\pi_{v}\}_{v\in V(G)}) \leftarrow \Pro^*(\var{\crs}, 1^\secpar, 1^n) \\
    \end{array}
    } \leq \epsilon(\secpar)
    .
\end{gather*}
Note that, as in the definition of SNARKs, the prover gets
to choose the false statement it would like to prove after seeing the $\crs$.

\paragraph{Succinctness} The $\var{\crs}$ and the proof $\pi$ are of length at most $\poly(\secpar, \log n)$.
\paragraph{Efficiency.} $\Ver$ runs in time $\poly(\lambda, |\pi|) = \poly(\lambda, \log n)$,
and $\Pro$ runs in time $\poly(\lambda, n)$.
\end{definition}
